# Street Fighting Game

This is a simple, interactive street-fighting game built using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. In this game, players can simulate attacks and healing moves. The game features two characters, **Nikhil** and **Rahul**, each with attack and heal options. Players can take turns performing actions, and the health points are dynamically updated based on each action.

### Features:
- **Attack and Heal**: Players have unique buttons for attacking and healing.
- **Dynamic Health Tracking**: Health points for each player are updated in real time.
- **Reset and Simulate**: A simulation button allows for automated gameplay, and a reset button lets players start fresh.

This project is designed to showcase basic web development skills and interactive UI functionality.
